## Acknowledgments

The AARM specification builds on research and insights from the broader AI security community. We thank the authors of the papers cited in the [References](/research/references) section for their foundational work on agent security, prompt injection, and runtime protection.

Special thanks to early reviewers who provided feedback on the action classification framework and context-aware evaluation model.
