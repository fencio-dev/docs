description: Three implementation approaches with different trust and integration properties.

## Overview

AARM can be implemented through three architectures:

| Architecture | Enforcement Point | Bypass Resistance | Integration |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Gateway** | Network | High | Low |
| **SDK** | Application | Medium | Medium |
| **eBPF** | Kernel | Very High | None |

  <Accordion title="Choose Gateway when..." icon="server">
    - MCP-based tool ecosystem
    - Network-level enforcement acceptable
    - Minimal agent changes required
    - Mature network security practices
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choose SDK when..." icon="code">
    - Rich context needed for policies
    - Non-MCP tools in use
    - Strong engineering capacity
    - Deep framework integration feasible
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choose eBPF when..." icon="microchip">
    - Maximum bypass resistance required
    - Agent code cannot be modified
    - Complete syscall visibility needed
    - High-security environment
  </Accordion>

## Layered Deployment

For defense in depth, combine architectures:

1. **Primary**: Gateway for MCP tools
2. **Secondary**: SDK for custom tools and rich context
3. **Tertiary**: eBPF as detection backstop

No single architecture is optimal for all dimensions.
