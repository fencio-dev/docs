## What is AARM?

**Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM)** is an open system specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. It defines what a runtime security system must do — not how to build it. An AARM system intercepts AI-driven actions before execution, accumulates session context including prior actions and data accessed, evaluates actions against organizational policy and contextual intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions (allow, deny, modify, defer, or require approval), and records tamper-evident receipts binding action, context, decision, and outcome for forensic reconstruction.

AARM is not a product, library, or service you install. It is a specification that describes the components, behaviors, and conformance requirements for systems that secure AI agents. You use AARM to **design and build** your own runtime security system, or to **evaluate** whether existing solutions meet the specification.

## The Runtime Security Gap

The security posture of AI systems is increasingly determined not by what models *say* but by what they *do*. Traditional security paradigms fail to address five characteristics of AI-driven actions:

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Irreversibility** | Tool executions produce permanent effects. Once a database is dropped or data exfiltrated, the damage is done. |
| **Speed** | Agents execute hundreds of actions per minute — far beyond human review capacity. |
| **Compositional risk** | Individual actions may satisfy policy while their composition constitutes a breach. |
| **Untrusted orchestration** | Prompt injection and indirect attacks mean the AI layer cannot be trusted as a security boundary. |
| **Privilege amplification** | Agents operate under static, high-privilege identities misaligned with least privilege. Small reasoning failures produce large-scale impact. |

Existing tools don't solve this:

- **SIEM** observes events *after* execution — too late to prevent harm
- **API gateways** verify *who* is calling, not *what* the action means
- **Firewalls** protect perimeters — but agents operate *inside* with legitimate credentials
- **Prompt guardrails** filter text, not actions — and are easily bypassed
- **Human-in-the-loop** doesn't scale, and can itself be exploited
- **IAM / RBAC** evaluates permissions in isolation — cannot detect compositional threats

These systems primarily support *automated* response: deterministic enforcement of pre-specified rules. They do not support *autonomous* response, in which a system reasons over accumulated context to decide whether an action should be permitted, modified, delayed, or blocked.

**The gap** lies at the intersection of **prevention** and **context-awareness**. AARM fills this gap.

## Action Classification

AARM recognizes that security decisions aren't binary. Actions fall into four categories:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Forbidden" icon="ban">
    Always blocked regardless of context. Hard policy limits defined by the organization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context-Dependent Deny" icon="shield-xmark">
    Allowed by policy, but blocked when context reveals inconsistency with the user's stated intent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context-Dependent Allow" icon="shield-check">
    Denied by default, but permitted when context confirms alignment with legitimate intent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context-Dependent Defer" icon="clock">
    Temporarily suspended when available context is insufficient, ambiguous, or conflicting for a confident decision.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

| Category | Example | Evaluation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Forbidden** | `DROP DATABASE production`, send to known malicious domains | Static policy → **DENY** |
| **Context-Dependent Deny** | Agent can send emails, but just read sensitive data and recipient is external | Policy ALLOW + context mismatch → **DENY** |
| **Context-Dependent Allow** | Agent wants to delete records; context shows user explicitly requested cleanup of their own test data | Policy DENY + context match → **STEP_UP** or **ALLOW** |
| **Context-Dependent Defer** | Agent initiates credential rotation outside maintenance window; context is ambiguous | Policy indeterminate → **DEFER** until resolved |

This is why AARM requires both static policy evaluation *and* context accumulation. An action that looks fine in isolation might be a breach in context. An action that looks dangerous might be exactly what the user asked for. And some actions simply cannot be resolved into a binary allow/deny without additional assurance.

## What an AARM System Does

A system conforming to AARM:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Intercepts">
    Captures AI-driven actions before they reach target systems
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accumulates Context">
    Tracks session state: the user's original request, prior actions, data accessed, and tool outputs — in a tamper-evident, append-only log
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluates">
    Assesses the action against static policy *and* contextual alignment with stated intent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enforces">
    Implements one of five authorization decisions: allow, deny, modify, defer, or require human approval
  </Step>
  <Step title="Records">
    Generates tamper-evident receipts capturing action, context, decision, and outcome
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Architectures

AARM defines four implementation architectures, each with distinct trust properties:

| Architecture | You Control | Bypass Resistance | Context Richness | Defer Support | AARM-Conformant Alone |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| [Protocol Gateway](/architectures/gateway) | Network | High | Limited | Partial | Yes |
| [SDK / Instrumentation](/architectures/sdk) | Code | Medium | Full | Full | Yes |
| [Kernel / eBPF](/architectures/ebpf) | Host | Very High | None | Limited | **No** |
| [Vendor Integration](/architectures/vendor-integration) | Policy only | Vendor-dependent | Vendor-dependent | Limited–Moderate | If hooks sufficient |

<Warning>
  Kernel-level (eBPF/LSM) implementations alone **cannot satisfy AARM conformance** for context-dependent classifications. eBPF must be deployed as a defense-in-depth backstop alongside a semantic-aware architecture.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Vendor-side governance hooks **must execute synchronously and prior to any side-effectful tool execution**. Asynchronous or best-effort hooks do not satisfy AARM requirements.
</Info>

For defense-in-depth, organizations should deploy multiple architectures in layers.

## Conformance Requirements

To claim AARM compliance, a system must satisfy these requirements:

| ID | Level | Requirement |
|----|-------|-------------|
| R1 | MUST | Pre-execution interception — block or defer actions before execution |
| R2 | MUST | Context accumulation — track prior actions, data classifications, original request |
| R3 | MUST | Policy evaluation with intent alignment — forbidden, context-dependent deny/allow/defer |
| R4 | MUST | Five authorization decisions — ALLOW, DENY, MODIFY, STEP_UP, DEFER |
| R5 | MUST | Tamper-evident receipts — cryptographically signed with full context |
| R6 | MUST | Identity binding — human, service, agent, session, and role/privilege scope |
| R7 | SHOULD | Semantic distance tracking — detect intent drift via embedding similarity |
| R8 | SHOULD | Telemetry export — structured events to SIEM/SOAR platforms |
| R9 | SHOULD | Least privilege enforcement — scoped, just-in-time credentials |

**AARM Core** (R1–R6): Baseline runtime security guarantees.
**AARM Extended** (R1–R9): Comprehensive runtime security with operational maturity features.

## Why an Open Specification?

The market for AI agent security is emerging rapidly, with multiple vendors building proprietary solutions. AARM aims to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Establish Baseline" icon="foundation">
    Define requirements before fragmentation forecloses interoperability
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enable Evaluation" icon="clipboard-check">
    Let buyers objectively assess vendor claims against defined criteria
  </Card>
  <Card title="Preserve Choice" icon="code-branch">
    Specify what systems must do, not how they must be built
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accelerate Adoption" icon="rocket">
    Provide implementation guidance, not just principles
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The goal is not to build AARM, but to define what an AARM-conformant system must do — enabling the market to compete on implementation quality rather than category definition.
